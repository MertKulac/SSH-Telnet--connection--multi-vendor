# SSH-Telnet--connection--multi-vendor
It is a code that tests the access of devices over ssh or telnet and runs both Cisco and Huawei multi-vendor at the same time.

First, we connect to a server. Then we enter our ip list as a command line.

By using Paramiko Expect as a library, we are making use of the Prompt feature.
